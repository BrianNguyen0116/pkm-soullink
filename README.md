Have a friend to play pokemon? Must be nice, here's a tool to make your lives easier. The features of the website include:

* Pokemon Inventory Tracking and Visualizer
* Valid Team-Combination Generation
* Pokemon Type Coverage

This is under the assumption that you are following the __no same primary type__ rule and you don't have the time to map out team combinations.

## üìù Instructions


### PC Management
To use the tool, you need to properly track the pokemon. It isn't too much assuming the user knows what a __JSON__ is.

* There are two object arrays: PC_1 and PC_2.
* Each object carries a _name_ and _type_.
    * The name is the shared nickname between you and your friend's pokemon.
    * The type is, you guessed it, the pokemon type.

Here is what is prepared when you visit the site:

```
{
    "PC_1": [
        {
            "name": "Wooper",
            "type": "Water"
        }
    ],
    "PC_2": [
        {
            "name": "Wooper",
            "type": "Ground"
        }
    ]
}
```

There are two ways to modify your PCs.
1. If you __love JSON__, you can write to an external json file separately while you're having fun and upload it using the ```Upload JSON``` button.
2. If you __hate JSON__, you can use the site form and save the file for future use through the ```Save as JSON``` button.


### The Actual Use

Once the team has been prepared, click ```Run``` and feel free to select pokemons you would like to prioritize. Each combination produced can be clicked to show a summary of the different teams and their coverage.

There isn't much else, the tool is intended to be simple and you can modify the code however you'd like.
